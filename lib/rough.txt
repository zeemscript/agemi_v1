Here’s the flow your landing page should have to feel seamless:

Hero (what you already have) → Eye-catching, CTA-focused.

Trusted By / Logos Bar → Show credibility.

Features Grid → 3–4 core features (cards with icons + short copy).

Dashboard Preview / Showcase → A mockup screenshot or illustration.

Why Us Section → Side-by-side text + image (use background glow).

Testimonials / Social Proof → Show real people or quotes.

Pricing / CTA Section → Push user to sign up or request demo.

Footer → Simple, minimal.
